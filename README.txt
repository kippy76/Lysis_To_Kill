Lysis to Kill 1.1

Lysis to Kill is an Android game written during the iGEM 2012 competition (see http://cwalker.me.uk/Software). It was written for Android 2.1 (SDK 7) though I notice it still runs on my Nexus 4. Due to commitments, it's been a while since I could update it, so I have returned to explore some improvements using the new Android Studio IDE.

The concept of the game was inspired by Splashback which was a Flash game originally developed for the Cartoon Network. The original concept involved adding drops of 'goo' to a playing board in order to burst 'blobs', creating a cascade of bursts. The aim was to clear the playing board in as few clicks as possible. In a similar fashion, Lysis To Kill draws on the same game concept with a twist to mirror the iGEM project.

You start the game with 10 clicks. You are in charge of the friendly, synthetically engineered E-coli cells (in green), and each time you click a cell it shrinks and eventually bursts. Your goal is to destroy all the C.diff cells with fCD27 endolysin, which is fired from your E.coli cells whenever they burst. Each level grants you an extra click, and points are awarded for every C.diff cell destroyed. Bonus points are awarded if you finish a level with a clear board.
